📊 IPL 2008–2020 Exploratory Data Analysis

This project presents a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches and ball-by-ball data from 2008 to 2020. It answers 35 detailed cricketing questions using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to extract valuable insights from historical IPL data, uncover trends, and support cricketing decisions and fan engagement.

📁 Dataset Information

IPL Matches 2008–2020: Contains match-level information like date, teams, toss decisions, winners, etc.

IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008–2020: Contains delivery-level information such as batsman, bowler, runs, extras, wickets, etc.

Both datasets are required and should be placed in the project root directory:

IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv

IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv
